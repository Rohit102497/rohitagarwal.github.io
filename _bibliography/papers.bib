  abstract={Streaming classification methods assume the number of input features is fixed and always received. But in many real-world scenarios demand is some input features are reliable while others are unreliable or inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based model called Auxiliary Network (Aux-Net), which is scalable and agile. It employs a weighted ensemble of classifiers to give a final outcome. The Aux-Net model is based on the hedging algorithm and online gradient descent. It employs a model of varying depth in an online setting using single pass learning. Aux-Net is a foundational work towards scalable neural network model for a dynamic complex environment requiring ad hoc or inconsistent input data. The efficacy of Aux-Net is shown on public dataset.},

    abstract = "Automatic Sarcasm Detection in conversations is a difficult and tricky task. Classifying an utterance as sarcastic or not in isolation can be futile since most of the time the sarcastic nature of a sentence heavily relies on its context. This paper presents our proposed model, C-Net, which takes contextual information of a sentence in a sequential manner to classify it as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Our model showcases competitive performance in the Sarcasm Detection shared task organised on CodaLab and achieved 75.0{\%} F1-score on the Twitter dataset and 66.3{\%} F1-score on Reddit dataset.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
