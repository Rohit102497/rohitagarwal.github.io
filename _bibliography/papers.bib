  abstract={Streaming classification methods assume the number of input features is fixed and always received. But in many real-world scenarios demand is some input features are reliable while others are unreliable or inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based model called Auxiliary Network (Aux-Net), which is scalable and agile. It employs a weighted ensemble of classifiers to give a final outcome. The Aux-Net model is based on the hedging algorithm and online gradient descent. It employs a model of varying depth in an online setting using single pass learning. Aux-Net is a foundational work towards scalable neural network model for a dynamic complex environment requiring ad hoc or inconsistent input data. The efficacy of Aux-Net is shown on public dataset.},

    abstract = "Automatic Sarcasm Detection in conversations is a difficult and tricky task. Classifying an utterance as sarcastic or not in isolation can be futile since most of the time the sarcastic nature of a sentence heavily relies on its context. This paper presents our proposed model, C-Net, which takes contextual information of a sentence in a sequential manner to classify it as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Our model showcases competitive performance in the Sarcasm Detection shared task organised on CodaLab and achieved 75.0{\%} F1-score on the Twitter dataset and 66.3{\%} F1-score on Reddit dataset.",

      abstract = "In many real-world scientific problems, generating ground truth (GT) for supervised learning is almost impossible. The causes include limitations imposed by scientific instrument, physical phenomenon itself, or the complexity of modeling. Performing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks such as segmentation, tracking, and analytics of small sub-cellular structures such as mitochondria in microscopy videos of living cells is a prime example. The 3D blurring function of microscope, digital resolution from pixel size, optical resolution due to the character of light, noise characteristics, and complex 3D deformable shapes of mitochondria, all contribute to making this problem GT hard. Manual segmentation of 100s of mitochondria across 1000s of frames and then across many such videos is not only herculean but also physically inaccurate because of the instrument and phenomena imposed limitations. Unsupervised learning produces less than optimal results and accuracy is important if inferences relevant to therapy are to be derived. In order to solve this unsurmountable problem, we bring modeling and deep learning to a nexus. We show that accurate physics based modeling of microscopy data including all its limitations can be the solution for generating simulated training datasets for supervised learning. We show here that our simulation-supervised segmentation approach is a great enabler for studying mitochondrial states and behaviour in heart muscle cells, where mitochondria have a significant role to play in the health of the cells. We report unprecedented mean IoU score of 91\% for binary segmentation (19\% better than the best performing unsupervised approach) of mitochondria in actual microscopy videos of living cells. We further demonstrate the possibility of performing multi-class classification, tracking, and morphology associated analytics at the scale of individual mitochondrion.",

%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
