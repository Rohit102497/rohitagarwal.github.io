I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Computer Science Department](https://en.uit.no/enhet/ifi){:target="\_blank"} at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/startsida){:target="\_blank"}, adivsed by [Dilip K. Prasad](https://sites.google.com/site/dilipprasad/){:target="\_blank"}.

My focus is on developing scalable and self-adaptive AI models for modelling complex biological systems including cell-cell and environmental interactions. I am also interested in NLP and online learning.
