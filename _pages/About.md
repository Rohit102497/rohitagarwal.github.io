I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Computer Science Department](https://en.uit.no/enhet/ifi){:target="\_blank"} at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/startsida){:target="\_blank"}, adivsed by [Dilip K. Prasad](https://sites.google.com/site/dilipprasad/){:target="\_blank"} and [Alexander Horsch] (https://en.uit.no/ansatte/alexander.horsch){:target="\_blank"}. My focus is on developing scalable and self-adaptive AI models for modelling complex biological systems including cell-cell and environmental interactions. I am also interested in NLP and online learning.

I did my graduate studies from [Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} in Mathematics and Computing. Before joining PhD, I worked at [Adobe Inc.](https://www.adobe.com/in/){:target="\_blank"}, Bangalore as a cloud engineer for a period of 10 months. Along with this, I am interested in Volleyball and Hiking. If anyone finds my profile interesting and wants to collaborate, do contact me.
