I am a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science Department](https://en.uit.no/enhet/ifi){:target="\_blank"} of [UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Troms√∏](https://en.uit.no/startsida){:target="\_blank"}. I am doing my research on machine learning under the supervision of [Dilip K. Prasad](https://sites.google.com/site/dilipprasad/){:target="\_blank"} and [Alexander Horsch](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/alexander.horsch){:target="\_blank"}, along with an esteemed pool of researchers of the Bio-AI team. My Ph.D. is a part of the [VirtualStain project](https://en.uit.no/project/virtualstain){:target="\_blank"} that aims to develop AI tools to label microscopic images without any chemical staining. My research focuses on developing scalable and self-adaptive AI models for modeling complex biological systems. Along with this, I am also interested in the field of NLP and Online Learning.

Before joining the Ph.D., I worked as a cloud engineer at [Adobe Inc.](https://www.adobe.com/in/){:target="\_blank"}, Bangalore for ten months. I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} pursuing Integrated Master in Mathematics and Computing.

I belong from a small place in India surrounded by tea gardens, forests, and mountains. My home is in the Buxa Tiger Reserve, India.  Thus, I like nature a lot. I love hiking, sitting alone, and gazing far away sitting at the top of the hill. I do a lot of running, and I play volleyball as a libero. Along with this I watch a lot of movies, tv-series and read novels. I am a big-time Friends lover. If anyone finds my profile interesting and wants to collaborate, do contact me.
